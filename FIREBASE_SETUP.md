# Firebase Setup Guide

## ✅ Firebase is Already Configured!

Your Firebase configuration has been automatically set up with the following details:

- **Project ID**: cancer-project-840cf
- **API Key**: AIzaSyC7K1hU0sKwGHwc1-5wh7iTpjHi0o_bMQ4
- **Auth Domain**: cancer-project-840cf.firebaseapp.com

## What's Been Set Up

### 1. Firebase Services
- ✅ **Authentication** - User sign up/sign in
- ✅ **Firestore Database** - User profiles and data storage
- ✅ **Analytics** - App usage tracking

### 2. Database Collections
The following Firestore collections will be created automatically when users sign up:

- **profiles** - User profile information
- **symptom_logs** - Health symptom tracking
- **appointments** - Medical appointments
- **community_posts** - Community discussions

### 3. Security Rules
Firebase Firestore security rules are automatically configured to:
- Allow authenticated users to read/write their own data
- Protect user privacy and data security

## How It Works

1. **User Registration**: When a user signs up, Firebase Auth creates the account
2. **Profile Creation**: A user profile is automatically created in Firestore
3. **Data Storage**: All app data is stored securely in Firestore collections
4. **Real-time Updates**: Firebase provides real-time data synchronization

## No Additional Setup Required

Your app is ready to use! The Firebase configuration is already in place and will work immediately.

## Testing

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Try creating a new user account
3. The user profile will be automatically created in Firestore
4. No more "Database error" messages!
